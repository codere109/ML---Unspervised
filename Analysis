In retrospect, I believe a train_test_split would've been more analytical versus kmeans because the KMeans has a lack of readability of cluter data. With the the train_test_split at least we could have been able to see where the clusters split at to run a better analysis. I also think doing a linear regression to see where the model draws a line between the cluster would be of great use as well. Overall, what we used was not terrible, but the scatter plot doesn't give a satisfying read.
